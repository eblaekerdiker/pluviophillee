I'm Ebla, I am an excited Frontend Developer. Right now I am doing my masters on Computer Software. I am interested in web development about 4 years and I was working hard to learn by myself. In 2021 fall semester I got accepted for Erasmus+ and lived in Poland for 5 months. I studied computer science in University of AGH which gave me a whole another perspective on software. And now I got accepted to Re:Coded bootcamp :smirk: so that means I am even working harder to learn :relieved:. I love doing website designs in my spare time and also going to the gym is one of my addictions :muscle:. But my favorite thing is watching sitcoms and cooking :purple_heart:. 

In 2021 I did my summer internship at Toros University IT department. While I am doing this internship I learned a lot about computer hardware and also algorithms. I worked with a team and worked on some projects. In this internship I used;
-Pyhton
-PHP
-Javascript
-CSS
-HTML
-SQL

Also in 2022 I did my long term internship as a frontend developer at Z software, ODTÃœ, Ankara. I worked with a team and I learned how to be a good teammate. The technologies and languages I used while I was doing my internship are;
-Angular.js
-Bootstrap
-Git
-HTML
-CSS

And as I mentioned before right now I am in ReCoded Frontend Development Bootcamp. I learned a lot about team work, how to communicate better and of course I learned a lot about coding.
