I'm Ebla, I am an excited Frontend Developer. Right now I am doing my masters on Computer Engineering. I am interested in web development about 4 years and I was working hard to learn by myself. But now I got accepted to Re:Coded bootcamp :smirk: so that means I am even working harder to learn :relieved:. I love going to the gym :muscle:, watching sitcoms and eating.
